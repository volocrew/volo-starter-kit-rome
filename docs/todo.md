- When deployment is finished, persist the endpoints and AppSync URL in a dotfile that can be read by the react app
- Ended up doing a script to display manually as I realized people might not want to have their values overwritten
- Update the main readme for a public open source library
    - [DOING] Should show how to deploy the stack
    - [DOING] Should show prereqs like cloning and npm installing in the sls folder
    - [TODO] highlight features of the app
    - [DONE] Show general architecture
    - [DONE] show how to update the config in the app.config.ts once deployed so the frontend can connect to the new backend
    - [TODO] document `seedStack` lambda
- Put roles into sls
    - Can we make a role public and address it by ARN? that way nobody has to create roles ever
      - Otherwise have the script create the relevant roles if they don't exist
    - this includes the RomeGodRole
    - this includes the cognito-admin
- [DOING] Remove Unneeded logos
- Put IAM role for appsync bot (ask zach about this) or have a way to create a new role
    - [TODO] We may just add a guide for this for now but would be great to get into sls
- Put cloudfront/s3/ACM into sls
    - Optimize this?
- Automate layer creation for lambdas
    - Maybe we can create public layers for this?
- [TODO] blow up old repo history with secrets and stuff 
- [TODO] write down a walkthrough of the frontend app
  - Sidebar
  - Have an example of the graphql query?
  - Show an existing admin page as en example on how to expand it
